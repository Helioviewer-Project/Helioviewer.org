2012/04/13

Comparison of takeScreenshot performance before/after support added to use
paletted JPEG 2000 images. The test image was a PROBA2 SWAP JP2 (2012_04_03__06_15_48__PROBA2_SWAP_SWAP_174.jp2). Two versions were compared:

(1) Grayscale JP2
(2) Paletted JP2

Similar tests were run for getTile and the results are compatible with the
takeScreenshot profiles.

Summary:

BEFORE:
 getTile: 204.654ms
 takeScreenshot: 1.254s
AFTER:
 getTile: 97.877ms
 takeScreenshot: 0.941s
