    <p>Selecting <img class="coordinate-option" src="/resources/images/hpr.png"/> shows the position of the mouse in approximate Helioprojective Radial (HPR) coordinates. The position of the mouse is converted to HPR coordinates using the small-angle approximation as described in Section 4.2 of Thompson (2006).</p>

    <p>HPC and HPR coordinates are calculated under the assumption that the Sun is always 1 AU from the observer. Note that these coordinates are approximate only and should not be used for operational purposes, or to support more precise scientific data analysis.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em">Helioprojective Cartesian Coordinates</h2>
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="resources/images/hpc_example.png" alt="Graphic describing helioprojective cartesian coordinates"/>
    <p>
        In helioprojective coordinates, everything in the sky is assumed to be
        projected onto a celestial sphere, as illustrated in the left-hand
        portion of the above graphic.
        <br/><br/>
        However, the Sun has a relatively small angular extent on the
        sphere when observed from the Earth. The full angular width of the Sun
        as seen from Earth is about half a degree. If we were to draw a line
        from Earth to the center of the Sun (with distance D), and from the
        Earth to a point on or close to the disk of Sun (at distance d from
        Earth), the angle between these lines would be small.
        <br/><br/>
        The right hand side of the above graphic shows that for small angles,
        the curve of the celestial sphere is approximately flat. In this
        situation, the angular separation between two points can be used
        as a measure of the physical distance between those points. The
        equation relating the distance X to the angle &theta;<span style='vertical-align: sub; font-size:10px;'>x</span> illustrates
        this, and can be derived trigonometrically.

    <p>
        In this coordinate system, a radial representation is used to represent the same point rather than a cartesian representation.
        The circle is still mapped onto the same celestial sphere, which means that the distance from origin (&rho;) is an approximation.
